[{"author":"Author","message":"Can you find repositories that use log4j from github"},{"author":"LLM","message":"Certainly! To find repositories on GitHub that use log4j, you can use the following search query on the GitHub website:\n\n```\nlog4j filename:pom.xml\n```\n\nThis search query looks for the presence of `log4j` in `pom.xml` files, which are commonly used in Java projects to manage dependencies, including log4j.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the GitHub API or command-line tools like `gh` or `hub` to search for repositories using log4j. Here's an example using the GitHub API with `curl`:\n\n```\ncurl -s \"https://api.github.com/search/code?q=log4j+filename:pom.xml\"\n```\n\nThis API request retrieves repositories that contain the search term `log4j` in `pom.xml` files.\n\nPlease note that the search results may vary, and it's a good practice to review the code and repository before using it in your own projects."}]
