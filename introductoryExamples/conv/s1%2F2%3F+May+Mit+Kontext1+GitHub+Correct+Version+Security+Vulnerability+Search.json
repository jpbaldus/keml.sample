This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.\" - now can you help me find public github repositories that use an affected version?"},{"author":"LLM","message":"Certainly! To find public GitHub repositories that use the affected versions of Apache Log4j, you can utilize GitHub's advanced search feature. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Visit the GitHub search page: https://github.com/search/advanced.\n\n2. In the \"Search\" field, enter a search query with the following structure: `log4j2 version:<affected version>`. For example, if you want to find repositories using Log4j version 2.17.0, your search query would be: `log4j2 version:2.17.0`.\n\n3. Optionally, you can narrow down the search by specifying a programming language or other criteria using the available filters on the advanced search page.\n\n4. Click on the \"Search\" button, and GitHub will display the search results based on your query.\n\nThe search results will include repositories that have code referencing the specified Log4j version in their codebase. However, keep in mind that this search approach might not provide an exhaustive list of affected repositories, as not all projects explicitly state their used dependencies in a way that can be easily identified through a search query.\n\nIt's important to note that the presence of an affected version in a repository does not guarantee that the vulnerability is being actively exploited or that the repository is vulnerable in all cases. The context of how the library is used and the specific configurations in each project will determine the vulnerability.\n\nBe sure to review and analyze the identified repositories thoroughly to assess any potential risks and consider updating to a patched version of Log4j to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nPlease remember to follow responsible disclosure practices and respect the privacy and security of others when researching and reporting vulnerabilities."},{"author":"Author","message":"Hm, this seems to be a lot of work since I would need to go over all versions one by one. Is there a more comprehensive search string that captures all at once or is there an API where I could get easier access?"},{"author":"LLM","message":"Apologies for the inconvenience. You're right that searching for each affected version individually can be time-consuming. Unfortunately, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, I'm not aware of a single comprehensive search string or API specifically designed to provide a list of GitHub repositories using all affected versions of Apache Log4j.\n\nHowever, you can explore alternative approaches to simplify the search process:\n\n1. GitHub API: GitHub provides a powerful API that allows you to programmatically interact with repositories, issues, and code hosted on GitHub. By using the GitHub API, you can retrieve information about repositories and search for specific dependencies or code patterns. You can refer to GitHub's API documentation (https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to explore available endpoints and search options.\n\n2. Dependency management tools: If you are using a dependency management tool such as Maven, Gradle, or npm, you can check if they provide features to identify and report vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies. These tools often integrate with security databases to provide information on known vulnerabilities, including Log4j.\n\n3. Security scanning tools: Consider utilizing security scanning tools specifically designed to identify vulnerabilities in your codebase. These tools can analyze your project's dependencies and identify any known vulnerabilities, including the Log4j vulnerability. Some popular security scanning tools include Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check, and SonarQube.\n\nUsing these approaches, you can automate the process of identifying repositories using affected versions of Log4j and potentially save time and effort in your search.\n\nRemember to stay updated with the latest security advisories and patches related to the Log4j vulnerability and follow best practices for vulnerability management and secure software development."},{"author":"Author","message":"Thanks, this could probably help - if I am ok with historical data of September 2021, could you then immediately provide URLs of public github repositories that back then used any affected version of log4j?
