# KEML sample

This project holds sample files on which you can try out the different KEML modules. You can explore all files these modules generate on a dedicated folder **case-study-log4j**.
You can run the KEML code on it to re-generate files and compare the content (most convenient with `git diff`).

## Expected Folder Structure
All modules of KEML make basic assumptions on where their input files are located relative to a base (topic) folder and where to write their files to.
The following folder/file names have a dedicated meaning and files within might be overwritten when running KEML code:

- **conv.json**: original conversations in one JSON file as exported from ChatGPT
- **conv/**:  Folder holding one JSON per conversation of conv.json. The conversation title is the file title. This folder can be generated using [keml.io](https://github.com/keml-group/keml.io). Its files are used when enhancing a KEML file with the original conversation via keml.io.
- **graphml/**: Folder holding graphML files for conversations. KEML files can be generated from those using [keml.io](https://github.com/keml-group/keml.io). Then, the graphML file name becomes both KEML file name and conversation title within KEML.
- **png/**: Optional folder, holding visualizations of the graphML files - mainly for documentation purposes and for viewing the graphML files without an editor like yEd.
- **keml/**: Folder holding KEML files for conversations. These files can either be generated from graphML sources via [keml.io](https://github.com/keml-group/keml.io) or created using the KEML editor you can generate from [keml](https://github.com/keml-group/keml). 
- **analysis/**: Folder holding all analysis files generated by [keml.analysis](https://github.com/keml-group/keml.analysis). Each file name starts with that of the respective keml file.

More details on assumptions on those files and generation mechanisms are available on the repsective repositories.
