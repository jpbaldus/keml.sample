However, please note that as an AI language model, I don't have direct access to the internet or real-time information. I can only provide you with a general approach to finding repositories related to Log4j on GitHub. \n\nTo find repositories that use Log4j, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the GitHub website: https://github.com/\n\n2. In the search bar at the top, enter the following search query:\n   ```\n   log4j language:java\n   ```\n\n   This search query specifies that you are looking for repositories that mention \"log4j\" and are written in Java.\n\n3. Press Enter or click the search button.\n\n4. GitHub will display a list of repositories that match your search query. You can further refine the search results using filters on the left side, such as \"Sort,\" \"Repositories,\" or \"Code.\"\n\n5. Explore the repositories to find the ones that are relevant to your needs.\n\nPlease note that the search results may not always be up to date, and the availability of repositories using Log4j may vary over time. Additionally, be sure to review the repositories' licenses, documentation, and code quality before using them.\n\nRemember to consider any security concerns related to the recent Log4j vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228 and related issues).
